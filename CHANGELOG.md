# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The project uses semantic versioning
before and after the first stable release.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-12

### Compatibility

- Repository schema v1 is the initial supported format. Repositories created by
  earlier pre-release builds are not compatible and must be recreated; the
  application refuses to open any repository that does not report schema v1.
- Application versioning restarts at 0.1.0. The project does not declare
  support for migrating data from previous pre-release builds.
